# AboutMe

## Summary
I'm not a software dev. I perform a hybrid role that fits somewhere between:
* Helping setup devops workflows
* Helping grow a quantitative research / data science team
* Project management, helping create or delpoy off-the-shelf software to fulfill business needs

My title is "blah blah", which is a bunch of meaningless words. I choose to interpret the title in the following ways:
* The buck ultimately stops with me. I am responsible for the people on my teams. They are adults and will be treated as such, but I am responsible for making sure that their professional needs are met.
* I am responsible for representing my teams to the business. Where there are miscommunications or mismatched expectations, it's my responsiblity to clarify and explain any differences in perception.
* I am responsibility for providing a clean line of communication between my team and the business.

## Working with me
* The things that matter
* Work life balance
* Things I've learned
